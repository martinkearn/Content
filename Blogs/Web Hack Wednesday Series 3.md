# Web Hack Wednesday Series 3

I'm very happy to announce that after quite a break, series 3 of Web Hack Wednesday will be launching on Wednesday 13th December 2017 at 12:00 mid-day (UK time). 

This series will be published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfB8nhgGYilj21J9bO_x6Q) where you can also find our full archive of older episodes too. 

We have 6 brand new episodes for you which cover the following exciting topics:

*   How GigSeekr have used advanced LUIS techniques in their bot (will be released at 12:00 on Wednesday 13th December)
*   Tips and Tricks for Visual Studio Code
*   How JD Sports used the Cortana Intelligence Recommendation solution
*   A look at the new CSS grid specification
*   What is new in Visual Studio 2017 for web developers
*   A look a the new WebP image specification

Each episode will be published at 12:00 mid-day for the next 6 weeks. 

For this series we have released show notes and samples on [GitHub](https://github.com/WebHackWednesday) so you can try out what we've covered in each episode yourself. 

Those of you who follow the show may also know that my wing-man Martin Beeby has since left Microsoft and started a position working for Oracle. 

Series 3 was all recorded before Martin's departure and is being released with his consent. 

Going forward I'm panning to do a new show following the same idea as Web Hack Wednesday with some other colleagues. 

I'll generally tweet announcements about the videos and associated show notes each Wednesday so watch [@MartinKearn](https://twitter.com/MartinKearn) and [#WebHackWednesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WebHackWednesday?src=hash) for updates. 

I hope you enjoy the series, please let me know about any feedback, topics you'd like to see covered or general comments via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MartinKearn).
