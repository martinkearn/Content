The latest version of the Bot Framework is v4.3 and it was released in March 2019. You can read about the exciting new features in the [Conversational AI updates for March 2019 Article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/conversational-ai-updates-for-march-2019/) from the Bot Framework product team.

At the time of writing (11th April 2019), the [templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BotBuilder.botbuilderv4), [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and [samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/master/README.md) had not yet been updated to reflect the new v4.3 patterns and practices.

There are new samples being produced in the [Samples Work in Progress branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/samples-work-in-progress). This features many patterns and practices which are new to v4.3.

There is not yet a v4.3 template or a project type that is suited to starting a new project with v4.3 patterns, therefore it is difficult to create a new bot project from scratch.

## Introducing the Starter Bot template

Myself, [Ibrahim Kivanc](https://github.com/ikivanc) and [Martin Simecek](https://github.com/msimecek) have been working on a project and associated VSIX which can be used as a great starting point for a .net Bot Framework v4.3 project that uses the latest patterns and practices.

We have looking through the [Samples Work in Progress branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/samples-work-in-progress) to determine common patterns shown in every sample and features which we think will be relevant to almost every bot project. 

We've rolled them all into the [Bot Starter Template for v4.3](https://github.com/martinkearn/Bot-Starter-Template)

The Starter Bot includes the following: 

- Bot project with v4.3.2 `Microsoft.Bot.Builder.*` NuGet packages
- Up-to-date patterns around `StartUp.cs`, `Program.cs`, `BotController.cs`, the main `ActivityHandler` architecture and `dialog` constrctors
- Basic dialog system with a root dialog and multiple child dialogs
- Global state being updated and used across `ActivityHandler` and `Dialog`s
- Passing objects to dialogs on construction
- Strings using RESX files
- A placeholder (commented out) example of using Dispatch, Luis and QNAMaker
