# Hack24 2018 The Microsoft AI For Good Challenge

On behalf of Microsoft UK, I'm very pleased to announce that we are proudly sponsoring the <a href="https://www.hack24.co.uk">Hack24 hackathon in Nottingham</a> on 10/11 March 2018. You can read more about our involvement in <a href="https://www.hack24.co.uk/blog/2018/1/10/microsoft-is-a-challenge-sponsor-for-hack24-2018"></a><a href="https://www.hack24.co.uk/blog/2018/1/10/microsoft-is-a-challenge-sponsor-for-hack24-2018">Hack24's sponsorship announcement.</a>

Technical communities are very important to Microsoft, and <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/">Tech Nottingham</a> and Hack24 are one of the countryâ€™s best so we are delighted to be involved.

Microsoft is a 'challenge sponsor' which means we get to set a challenge for the hack and give away prizes for the best team. This article will give you all the detail of our challenge.

<h2>The Microsoft 'AI for good' challenge</h2>
At Microsoft we care about technology but we also care about how technology can be used for good which is why at Hack24, we challenge you to use your time to create something good.

We're looking for something that will make lives better, helps the environment, helps people with disabilities, addresses social issues, helps people in a crisis or disaster event; basically anything that you could label as 'technology for good'. We're keeping this part of the challenge very broad and we're excited to see what you build. If you are looking for inspiration, check this insightful article <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/moment-forever-changed-our-lives-satya-nadella/">'The moment that forever changed our lives'</a> from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In terms of technology, we'd like hackers to use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a> and/or the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/bot-service/">Microsoft Azure Bot Service</a>. These technologies are both exciting components to Microsoft's overall AI platform and open the door to AI for the masses.

The specific judging criteria is as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Creative and interesting use of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a><span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;line-height: 24px;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px"> and/or the </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/bot-service/">Microsoft Azure Bot Service</a>.</li>
 	<li>Creation of a functional project that works within it intended scope.</li>
 	<li>Creation of a project that helps a good cause.</li>
</ul>

We'll be holding a brief session on the Saturday to help people get up to speed with these technologies and we'll have experts (<a href="http://martink.me/">Martin Kearn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frances_tibble">Frances Tibble</a>) at the hack to help all weekend.

<h2>Win an Xbox One</h2>
The winning team will receive an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/consoles/xbox-one-s/rocket-league-blast-off-500gb">Xbox One S Rocket League Blast-Off Bundle</a> for each team member.

Teams are restricted to a maximum of 4 members as per the <a href="https://www.hack24.co.uk/faq/">Hack24 terms</a>.
