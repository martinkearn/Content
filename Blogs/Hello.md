# Hello

OK, so here goes ....... this is my first entry in my brand new SharePoint / Office 12 / Information Woker blog!

I've just started a new job with Microsoft UK working as an MCS consultant and hope to bring lots of usefull 'notes from the field' regarding Sharepoint 2003 and Office 12 (and anything else that I happen to come accross). This blog will mostly have a technical focus, but I'll probably just put anythying up here that looks usefull!

Some of you may have seen my old blog on MSN spaces (http://spaces.msn.com/members/martin-kearn). That blog is now in-active, but does still have some usefull stuff on there so from time-to-time I may occasionally refer to it.

That'll do for now - happy reading
